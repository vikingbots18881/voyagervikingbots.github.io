<img class="fixed-size-img centered" src="archive/2023/img/bing.jpeg" class="resize-logo" alt="bing" "/>
                        
                        
                        
                    
<p>                                   
Next, when you are on the Bing app, if you have a "sign in" screen on your device, you need a Microsoft account.
If you don't have a Microsoft account or don't know what it is, you can go to this
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80ow9FoMDvA" target="_blank">link.</a> 
</p>

<p>
When you are signed in, you will be on the homepage with many options. 
 Then, scroll over until you see the paintbrush and picture icon. Click
on it. 
<img  src="archive/2023/img/art_location.jpeg" class="img-1" alt="bug. fix it" "/>
	

<p>

<p>
The lightning bolts right by the text bar in a yellow circle, those are called boosts. Boosts make you wait less for your picture to be ready, but you can still genorate pictuers without boosts, but it will take longer.
