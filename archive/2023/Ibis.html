You can create your own colors and save them between drawings, Letting you quickly get them.
</p>

<p>   
You can blur, special effect, erase, eyedrop(color copying tool) and brush of course!

To open better brushes you can get premium which you have to pay every month for, or watch an add to-get them free for 18 hours! Which opens much more creativity!

You can layer,and have basically outlines for stuff that could colored or not colored.

<p>
You can make very detailed and defined pictures and I hope this app opens many more creativity tabs for you to take.
